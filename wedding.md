### No gifts please!

All we want is for you to celebrate with us and have an enjoyable time. Please avoid boxed gifts and flowers, as we will not be able to carry them back to Oslo. Any financial contributions will be donated to worthy social causes, such as the [SOS Children's Village](http://www.soschildrensvillages.in/Pages/default.aspx) in Chennai.
